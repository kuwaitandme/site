    div.sub-title Welcome to Kuwait &amp; Me
    p
      | We hope you find it useful. By accessing our servers, websites, or
      | content therefrom (together, "Kuwait &amp; Me"), you agree to these Terms of Use
      | ("TOU"), last updated December 05, 2014.

    div.sub-title License
    p
      | If you are 18 or older, we grant you a limited, revocable,
      | nonexclusive, nonassignable, nonsublicensable license to access
      | Kuwait &amp; Me in compliance with the TOU; unlicensed access is unauthorized.
      | You agree not to license, distribute, make derivative works, display,
      | sell, or "frame" content from Kuwait &amp; Me, excluding content you create and
      | sharing with friends/family. You grant us a perpetual, irrevocable,
      | unlimited, worldwide, fully paid/sublicensable license to use, copy,
      | perform, display, distribute, and make derivative works from content
      | you post.

    div.sub-title Use
    p
      | You agree not to use or provide software (except for general purpose
      | web browsers and email clients, or software expressly licensed by us)
      | or services that interact or interoperate with Kuwait &amp; Me, e.g. for downloading,
      | uploading, posting, flagging, emailing, search, or mobile use. Robots,
      | spiders, scripts, scrapers, crawlers, etc. are prohibited, as are
      | misleading, unsolicited, unlawful, and/or spam postings/email.
      | You agree not to collect users' personal and/or contact information
      | ("PI").

    div.sub-title Moderation
    p
      | You agree we may moderate Kuwait &amp; Me access and use in our sole
      | discretion, e.g. by blocking (e.g. IP addresses), filtering, deletion,
      | delay, omission, verification, and/or access/account/license
      | termination. You agree (1) not to bypass said moderation, (2) we are
      | not liable for moderating, not moderating, or representations as to
      | moderating, and (3) nothing we say or do waives our right to
      | moderate, or not.

    div.sub-title Sales
    p
      | You authorize us to charge your account for Kuwait &amp; Me fees.
      | Unless noted, fees are in US dollars; tax is additional. To the
      | extent permitted by law, fees are nonrefundable, even for posts we
      | remove. We may refuse purchases, which may place a hold on your
      | account.

    div.sub-title Disclaimer
    p
      | MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE LAWS PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND OTHER CONTRACT
      | PARTIES, LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS AND
      | RESPONSIBILITIES. WE RESPECT SUCH LAWS; NOTHING HEREIN SHALL WAIVE
      | RIGHTS OR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED.

    p
      | To the extent permitted by law, (1) we make no promise as to Kuwait
      | &amp; Me, its completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness,
      | propriety, security or reliability; (2) your access and use are at
      | your own risk, and Kuwait &amp; Me is provided "AS IS" and "AS
      | AVAILABLE"; (3) we are not liable for any harm resulting from (a)
      | user content; (b) user conduct, e.g. illegal conduct; (c) your Kuwait
      | &amp; Me use; or (d) our representations; (4) WE AND OUR OFFICERS,
      | DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES ("Kuwait &amp; Me ENTITIES"), DISCLAIM ALL
      | WARRANTIES &amp; CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF
      | MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT;
      | (5) Kuwait &amp; Me ENTITIES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
      | INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS
      | (E.G. OF PROFIT, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL); (6) IN NO EVENT SHALL
      | OUR TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED $100 OR WHAT YOU PAID US IN THE PAST YEAR.

    div.sub-title Claims
    p
      | You agree (1) any claim, cause of action or dispute ("Claim")
      | arising out of or related to the TOU or your Kuwait &amp; Me use is
      | governed by California ("CA") law regardless of your location or any
      | conflict or choice of law principle; (2) Claims must be resolved
      | exclusively by state or federal court in San Francisco, CA (except
      | we may seek injunctive remedy anywhere); (3) to submit to personal
      | jurisdiction of said courts; (4) any Claim must be filed by 1 year
      | after it arose or be forever barred; (5) not to bring or take part
      | in a class action against Kuwait &amp; Me Entities; (6) (except
      | government agencies) to indemnify Kuwait &amp; Me Entities for any
      | damage, loss, and expense (e.g. legal fees) arising from claims
      | related to your Kuwait &amp; Me use; (7) you are liable for TOU
      | breaches by affiliates (e.g. marketers) paid by you, directly or
      | indirectly (e.g. through an affiliate network); and (8) to pay us for
      | breaching or inducing others to breach the "USE" section, not as a
      | penalty, but as a reasonable estimate of our damages (actual damages
      | are often hard to calculate): $0.10 per server request, $1 per post,
      | email, flag, or account created, $1 per item of PI collected, and
      | $1000 per software distribution, capped at $25,000 per day.

    div.sub-title Misc
    p
      | Users complying with prior written licenses may access Kuwait &amp;
      | Me thereby until authorization is terminated. Otherwise, this is the
      | exclusive and entire agreement between us. If a TOU term is
      | unenforceable, other terms are unaffected. If TOU translations
      | conflict with the English version, English controls. See Privacy
      | Policy for how we collect, use and share data.
