        | or services that interact or interoperate with Kuwait &amp; Me, e.g. for downloading,
        | uploading, posting, flagging, emailing, search, or mobile use. Robots,

      p.columns
        | You agree we may moderate Kuwait &amp; Me access and use in our sole
        | discretion, e.g. by blocking (e.g. IP addresses), filtering, deletion,

        | not liable for moderating, not moderating, or representations as to
        | moderating, and (3) nothing we say or do waives our right to

        | remove. We may refuse purchases, which may place a hold on your
        | account.

      h3.columns.columns Disclaimer
      p.columns
        | MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE LAWS PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND OTHER CONTRACT
        | PARTIES, LIMITING THEIR ABILITY TO WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS AND
        | RESPONSIBILITIES. WE RESPECT SUCH LAWS; NOTHING HEREIN SHALL WAIVE
        | RIGHTS OR RESPONSIBILITIES THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED.

      p.columns
        | To the extent permitted by law, (1) we make no promise as to Kuwait
        | &amp; Me, its completeness, accuracy, availability, timeliness,
        | propriety, security or reliability; (2) your access and use are at
        | your own risk, and Kuwait &amp; Me is provided "AS IS" and "AS
        | AVAILABLE"; (3) we are not liable for any harm resulting from (a)
        | user content; (b) user conduct, e.g. illegal conduct; (c) your Kuwait
        | &amp; Me use; or (d) our representations; (4) WE AND OUR OFFICERS,
        | DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES ("Kuwait &amp; Me ENTITIES"), DISCLAIM ALL
        | WARRANTIES &amp; CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OF
        | MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT;
        | (5) Kuwait &amp; Me ENTITIES ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
        | INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS
        | (E.G. OF PROFIT, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL); (6) IN NO EVENT SHALL
        | OUR TOTAL LIABILITY EXCEED $100 OR WHAT YOU PAID US IN THE PAST YEAR.

      //- h3 Claims
      //- p
        | You agree (1) any claim, cause of action or dispute ("Claim")
        | arising out of or related to the TOU or your Kuwait &amp; Me use is
        | governed by California ("CA") law regardless of your location or any
        | conflict or choice of law principle; (2) Claims must be resolved
        | exclusively by state or federal court in San Francisco, CA (except
        | we may seek injunctive remedy anywhere); (3) to submit to personal
        | jurisdiction of said courts; (4) any Claim must be filed by 1 year
        | after it arose or be forever barred; (5) not to bring or take part
        | in a class action against Kuwait &amp; Me Entities; (6) (except
        | government agencies) to indemnify Kuwait &amp; Me Entities for any
        | damage, loss, and expense (e.g. legal fees) arising from claims
        | related to your Kuwait &amp; Me use; (7) you are liable for TOU
        | breaches by affiliates (e.g. marketers) paid by you, directly or
        | indirectly (e.g. through an affiliate network); and (8) to pay us for
        | breaching or inducing others to breach the "USE" section, not as a
        | penalty, but as a reasonable estimate of our damages (actual damages
        | are often hard to calculate): $0.10 per server request, $1 per post,
        | email, flag, or account created, $1 per item of PI collected, and
        | $1000 per software distribution, capped at $25,000 per day.

        | Me thereby until authorization is terminated. Otherwise, this is the
        | exclusive and entire agreement between us. If a TOU term is
        | unenforceable, other terms are unaffected. If TOU translations
        | conflict with the English version, English controls. See Privacy
        | Policy for how we collect, use and share data.
