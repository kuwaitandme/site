# This file contains virtual-host configurations for Nginx. Ideally you would
# put this file inside of the "sites-enabled" folder or any equivalent.
#
# This configuration file creates two main servers:
#   1. The first server listens to http/https connection on the given domain and
# forwards all requests to the app which is listening on port 3000.
#   2. The second server listens to http connections on the given domain and
# simply servers the files. The goal behind this server is that it's contents
# get cached by Cloudflare's CDN (which you can do by signing up with CloudFlare
# for free!). Cloudflare automatically gives you a https connection so this
# server doesn't really need a https certificate.
#
# You must have your SSL certificates ready. If you're deploying in development
# then custom certificates will do.
###


###
# Use this to control where the main server should listen to. Since the main
# server proxys all the requests to this server, changing parameters like the
# port number can have the virtual host listen to the new port number instead.

# HTTP server to redirect to non-www (https) domain.
#
# Google and some other sites rank you based on the fact if you have a 'www'
# domain or not. Also this server redirects non-https requests to http requests.
#
# You can switch this server off if you don't have SSL certificates but then
# make sure to add port 80 the main server below.

# Note that we will enable Cloudflare's CDN on this server, which means that we
# will get HTTPS also. However in development you would have to create your own
