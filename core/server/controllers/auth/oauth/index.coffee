###*
 * This controller is responsible for authenticating the user with the
 * different OAuth mechanisms installed into the app.
 *
 * It dynamically runs for any oauth provider and carefully handles any possible
 * error (such as giving a 404 for an non-existent oauth method.)
 *
 * @param String provider     The oauth provider with which we must authenticate
 *                            with. (Must be initialized with passport).
 *
 * @example
 * GET sitename.tld/auth/oauth/facebook     -> 302 facebook.com/oauth/....
 * GET sitename.tld/auth/oauth/fakenetwork  -> 404
