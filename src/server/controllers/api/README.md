API - Documentation
===================

This file documents the different components of the API. The API is used primarily to communicate with the Angular.js frontend and mobile application. Because of the vast number of API functions, each of them has  documentation in it's own folder. 

A brief description about each route and explanation about the file hierarchy is explained here.
