###*
 * This is a controller for the login via Email. It makes sure that that the
 * user logs in properly when the correct credentials are given and creates a
 * login event.
 *
 * On successful login, the controller returns a JSON of the logged in user and
 * sets the session cookie.
 *
 * @param  String username         The username (email) of the user
 * @param  String password         The password of the user
 * @required username, password
 *
 * @example
 * POST sitename.tld/api/auth/email/login {..} -> 200 JSON { user }
 * POST sitename.tld/api/auth/email/login {..} -> 400 JSON "error message"
