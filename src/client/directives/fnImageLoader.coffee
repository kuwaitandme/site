# This directive is responsible for properly loading images. It loads given
# image and calls the appropriate expression given in the 'fail' and 'success'
# attributes.
#
# This directive requires the 'src' attribute (to load the image obviously),
# and uses the expressions in 'fn-image-success' and 'fn-image-fail' to handle
# what happens when the image load succeeds or fails respectively.
